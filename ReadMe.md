## ðŸ”¹Introduction  
This Project represents an Airline Reservation System and is developed for the basic operations involved in the reservation of a Flight.  
This project is developed under PHP Scripting Language and uses MySQL database and a few pheripherals that include HTML CSS and JQuery.   
This project helps in the reservation of flights and also helps to book and search flights in a very simple and efficient manner.  
This project includes the management of various users of the system, keeps a general record of all the various books on a customers account, and also helps in managing the seats and flights and even helps the admin add update or delete flights.  

## ðŸ”¹Requirements  
VS Code or any Code Editor.  
Xampp Server or Wamp Server.  
Chrome, Firefox or any similar Browser.  

## ðŸ”¹Proposed System  
The proposed system, being web-based, is very efficient and effective from the point of view of work productivity and time.  
It is less tedious to manage operations in a flight booking system available in branch. The system is run manually by the database.  
It is difficult to run efficiently by manpower, and difficult to respond every user within a short period. Thus we came to know the essential need to make its web application.  
 
## ðŸ”¹Scope  
With this system, Entire Operations in Reservation are fully automated. Unlike the traditional system where booking was done manually, this system maintains records in a database. Typical example of these records includes flight bookings, airports, class of flying, etc.  
The main Scope of this Software is to automate the existing system of manually maintained records of the sales, reservations, records, supplier and customer details, and other related transactions of the seller.  

## ðŸ”¹Advantages  
â€¢	No possibility of missing database.  
â€¢	The request will help users to ask for new bookings.  
â€¢	Saves a lot of time in searching, requesting and issuing.  
â€¢	The system contains all the up-to-date information and stores information.  
â€¢	All the information about the users and bookings can be maintained in an effective and efficient manner.  

## ðŸ”¹Limitations and Future Scope  
This project has huge potential to improve and grow.  
â€¢	A Payment option can be refined and devloped in a better way.  
â€¢	Cancelation of the ticket and refund functionality needs to be made for better service.  
â€¢	Information of the passenger can be displayed on the website whenever necessary or requested.  
â€¢	To perform necessary validation while accepting reservation data and display status, by automatically checking out the Seat Availability, Updating Seat Plan and Verification of operation of flight on the particular date.   

## ðŸ”¹Installation  
â€¢ Requires a wamp or xampp server to run.  
â€¢ Once downloaded and installed refer to: **Fly-Nebula > InstallMe.md**  
  for instructions and steps on how to innitialize and run the system.
